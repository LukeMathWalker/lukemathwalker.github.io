I'm a math master student who is completing his higher education at the University of Trieste/SISSA.

I'm interested in the usage of mathematical tools to model physical/biological/socio-economic phenomena of interest, using both analytical (PDEs) and statistical tools (data analysis, machine learning, deep learning).

I'm currently working on my master thesis: we're using deep learning techniques to improve and speed up the state-of-the-art computational models currently available to perform cell simulations in healthy and cancer tissues.
